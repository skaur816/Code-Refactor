# Homework 2: Submission 2
Grader comments were that the header did not match the expected output image. Assignment requirements were to refactor a given source code and use semantic HTML to organize the code. I did a fresh start of the assignment to determine why the header was not working. I decided to keep original class names in this submission, however, the tag elements were changed.
